HTML Advanced



## Project HTML Advanced Overview

This project is the starting foundation of a website. It's the skeletal structure built entirely in HTML. The Project is a walkthrough on how to create the layout starting with the Header, all the way down to the Footer.

Ideally, the finished project will look like this

Note: I used Star Wars references in my initial build out to keep myself entertained while working on the project. When adding the CSS, I will be changing all the headers to match the original website.
## Learning Objectives

#### What is HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Some people argue it's not a programming language, but Language is in the name.. However, HTML is the standard language used to create and 'design' webpages. 


#### How to create an HTML page from a wireframe
First you must understand what a wireframe IS. It's a visual guide on creating an HTML webpage. A blueprint if you will. My `index.html` page is a visual representation of creating an HTML page from a wireframe.

####  What is a markup language
In simplistic terms, `markup language` is a way to add special codes to a document to tell a computer how to display it. The codes are called `tags`, and HTML, given it's name, is a variation of a markup language. 


#### What is the DOM
DOM stands for DOcument Object Model. It's a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing programs to manipulate the content, structure and style of the document dynamically.

#### What is an element / tag
An `Element` is a piece of a webpage defined by it's <tag> content <end tag>. The `tag` is what defines what that element is. For example, if I used `<h1> This is a Heading </h1>`, it would display a header that displays `This is a Heading`

#### What is an attribute
An `Attribute` is something that provides additional information about an `Element`. `Attributes` are always included in the opening tag. For example;
`<a href="https://www.google.com target "_blank">GOOGLE IT</a>` would create a link that when selected, opens a new tab and goes to Google. In the example, `href` is the `Attribute` that specifies the URL, and `target` is an `Attribute` that specifies how to open the link.

#### What the purpose of each HTML tag

The purpose of each HTML tag is to define what that element is, or will be. There are a plethora of HTML tag options, such as 

`<h1>` Would be a heading 1 value
`<p>` Would be a paragraph. 
`<img>` Embeds an image.
