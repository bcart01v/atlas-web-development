# Atlas

## CSS Advanced

#### This is a placeholder Readme.


In this project, I attempted to fully recreate the HTML and CSS from the Figma file provided. The toughest challenge was of course the Videos, but the second toughest challenge was getting everything spaced correctly with the Figma File, while juggling flex boxes and hoping everything aligns correctly without much changing.

I feel like I overly used specific CSS styling, and I feel like if I started from scratch I could have done a lot better and simplified a lot of things, but I suppose that was the entire point of this project. 

Also, this is not the type of readme I wanted to create, but it's the type I have the time and brainpower for.

I also did my best to make sure this page is responsive, but there are a few bugs which I'm sure you can spot right off the bat.
